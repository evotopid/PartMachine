Project Description
===================

PartMachine is a RubyOnRails application which gives the user the possibility to manage
his electronic components in a intuitive way.
You can add your parts, set how many parts you have, sort them in categories, search them
(search isn't fully implemented yet), set their locations (also still don't implemented
yet) any perhaps more things, but I don't know exactly what right now.
Currently PartMachine is still in development so many things still don't work,
if you find a feature that isn't implemented right now or a bug you can fill of course
an issue in the Github issue tracker, but it could be possible that I'm already working
on that.

License
=======

Currently, as this project is still in early development, I still didn't choose a
license for this application. So, later I'll sure add a license, but currently
all those files are my property, of course if you want to use the code (but currently
the codebase is relatively small) in one of your projects you can ask me per email
for the permissions.
